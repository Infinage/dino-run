## Dino game automation

Ideally the end user should be able to screen share on their browser similar to Google meet and once the dino run game starts, the browser should be able to send controls to jump or duck. Currently the implementation requires the appl to be run on the end user machine.

1. Detect if we are on the dino game screen
2. If we are start the game with a space press or an enter key press
3. Detect the obstacles on the screen and either choose to duck or jump
